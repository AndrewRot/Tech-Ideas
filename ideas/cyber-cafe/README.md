# Cyber Cafe

One of the things I want to do in the next 10 years is open up a "cyber cafe" / events space - that serves as a shared work space during the day - where I am there to offer free help & teach lesser priviledge kids about technology / create a community for people to help each other & build things.
But i wanna do it in a lesser affluent area, like if in the US, a place like detroit. Or do it somewhere else like South America or South East Asia.
And make it into a modular event space so I can host meetups / the place into a lounge / bar / club in the evenings / on weekends. But just a more fun way to interact with people.
